My First post! 

Just proves that I can `clone` the repo, run the `bundle update`, serve locally with `jekyll serve --drafts` and, and modify files for a post.

I cloned the orig. repo instead of forking... so i'll switch that workflow up instead of creating a `dev_kb` branch. 

was getting a "invalid _sass folder" warning about the theme, so fixed that in the `_config.yml` by adding `theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll` and then adding `gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"` to the Gemfile...

hope that's ok..

 :+1: for emojis!

 now for a package with Gifs!
