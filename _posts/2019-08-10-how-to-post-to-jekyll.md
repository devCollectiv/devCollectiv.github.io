You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary [front matter][front-matter]. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

To add new drafts, simply add a file in the `_drafts` directory that follows the convention `name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. This is the same format as the post filename except the date is omitted. To preview your site with drafts, run with the --drafts switch`jekyll serve --drafts` or `jekyll build --drafts`. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
